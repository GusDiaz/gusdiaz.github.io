# gusdiaz.github.io

## Welcome

This is my first repo and my first version of my personal website.

Thanks to Github anyone can have their own GitHub Page.

## Features

This site is made with plain html, css and javascript but some things that are worth to notice are:

- Github Page
- Some images are actually fonts
- Sticky menu
- Wow effect
- Libraries from CDN
- Responsiveness
- CNAME
- Favicon
- Flag icon
- README ;)
